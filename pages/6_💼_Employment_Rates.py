st.write(""" ### Ukraine-Russia War Impact On Employment Rates ##  """)

st.write("""
The prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had a major effect on the world economy, particularly employment rates in Europe and the US.
In Europe, the economic sanctions against Russia have hit countries that rely heavily on exports, such as Germany, Italy, and France. These countries have seen a decline in their exports to Russia, which has had negative effects on their economies and employment rates.     
In the United States, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on employment rates has been less direct, but still significant. The sanctions have affected the global oil market, leading to lower oil prices, which has had negative effects on the US oil industry and employment rates in that sector.
Furthermore, the instability caused by the conflict has led to increased military spending by many countries, including the US, which has diverted resources away from other sectors and potentially impacted employment rates in those areas.

st.write(""" ## Employment Rate In the Unite State
""")

st.write(""" The conflict began in 2014, and since then, it has escalated into a full-blown military and diplomatic crisis, affecting many countries around the world.
One way that the Russia-Ukraine War has affected the employment rate in the United States is through the imposition of economic sanctions. In response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, the United States and the European Union imposed a series of economic sanctions on Russia. These sanctions have targeted key sectors of the Russian economy, such as energy, finance, and defense.
Numerous American businesses who conduct business with Russia have been harmed as a result of these restrictions. For instance, businesses that export items to Russia have experienced a sharp fall in sales, which has resulted in the loss of jobs in some sectors. Employer possibilities have decreased as a result of the impact on businesses that rely on Russian imports. Yet, these circumstances had no impact on the growth of the US labor force, which, as you can see, was unaffected by the conflict and will continue to increase gradually beyond February 2022.

st.write(""" ## Unemployment In Europe
""")
st.write("""The Russia-Ukraine War has had a significant impact on unemployment in Europe, particularly in countries that have strong economic ties with Ukraine or Russia. The conflict has led to a decline in trade and investment, which has resulted in job losses and increased unemployment in many European countries.
One of the most affected countries is Ukraine itself, where the war has devastated the economy and led to a sharp increase in unemployment. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in Ukraine increased from 7.6% in 2013 to 9.2% in 2015, with more than 1.5 million people losing their jobs.
The war has also had a ripple effect on other European countries, especially those with strong trade and economic ties with Ukraine and Russia. For example, Germany, which is one of Russia's largest trading partners, has been impacted by the economic sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of the war. This has led to job losses in German industries that rely heavily on exports to Russia, such as the automotive and chemical industries.
In addition to Germany, other European countries that have been affected by the Russia-Ukraine conflict include Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. These countries have seen a decline in trade with Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in job losses and increased unemployment.
Furthermore, the ongoing conflict has also led to a rise in refugees and asylum seekers, which has put a strain on the labor markets of many European countries. According to the European Commission, the influx of refugees has contributed to a rise in unemployment in some countries, such as Greece and Italy.
